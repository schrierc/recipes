## Ingredients 
-  ⅔ cup creamy peanut butter
-  ½ cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
-  1 cup old fashioned oats
-  ½ cup ground flax seeds
-  2 tablespoons honey

## Instructions

1.  Combine all 5 ingredients in a medium bowl. Stir to combine.
1.  Place in the refrigerator for 15-30 minutes so they are easier to roll.
1.  Roll into 12 bites and store in the fridge for up to a week.

    We typically use a mini ice cream scoop and get around 25 balls.
    The smaller balls are easier to eat and contain less calories.

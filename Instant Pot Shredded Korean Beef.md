This is a modified variant of the Crockpot version.

## Serves
6-8

## Ingredients
-  3-4 pounds beef roast (I used a top sirloin or trimmed chuck roast)
-  1 14-ounce can pears, drained (fresh pears work, too)
-  1/2 cup brown sugar
-  1/2 cup soy sauce
-  1 head garlic (approx 10 small cloves)
-  1 inch fresh ginger root, peeled and grated
-  2 tablespoons seasoned rice wine vinegar
-  1 tablespoon sesame oil
-  1 whole jalapeno, diced (optional. be careful! use gloves!)

## Directions
1.  Make the sauce: Pulse pears, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, and brown sugar until mostly smooth.
1.  Trim any fat off the meat and cut into a few large chunks (it will shred, but cutting the meat helps it cook faster). 
1.  Marinate meat for a few hours in a plastic bag.
1.  Place in an Instant Pot and cover with the sauce.
1.  Cook on high pressure (manual) for 45 minutes. Quick release steam.
1.  Shred the meat in the Instant Pot with two forks.

Make into tacos, rice bowl, etc.

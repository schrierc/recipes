## Ingredients
-  1.5 lb Pork shoulder
-  1.5 cups chicken broth/stock
-  1/4 cup red wine or apple cider vinegar
-  1/2 onion, diced
-  2 cloves garlic, minced/crushed
-  1 tbsp chili pepper
-  1 tbsp ground pepper (fresher is better)
-  1.5 tbsp salt
-  2 tsp cumin
-  1 tbsp brown sugar (optional, but good if you're going the BBQ route)
-  1/2 tbsp cayenne pepper

## Steps
1.  Pour chicken broth and vinegar into slow cooker, and add the diced onion and crushed or minced garlic.
1.  Wash and pat dry pork shoulder completely with paper towels. cut it in half/fourths so it fits in slow cooker better.
1.  Mix all dry spices together in a small bowl.
1.  Generously rub spices onto pork, covering every bit of it that you can with the spices. You may need to make more spices depending on how much pork shoulder you have, this is just my usual estimate.
1.  Place pork on top of stock and onion/garlic mixture in slow cooker. Turn it on low, and leave it be for about eight hours. If pork isn't shredding to your likeness, put it in for 2-3 more hours.


## OPTIONAL: BBQ sauce
The recipe above is for non-BBQ pork. If you want it to be more saucy, it's a pretty easy next step.
After pork cooks, remove it from the crock pot and shred it (should basically fall apart, I can usually shred it by just pressing on it with a fork). Remove excess onions that haven't dissolved, and maybe half the remaining brother from the slow cooker.
Add in shredded pork, and mix around to absorb remaining stock. Add in favorite BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's is always a crowd pleaser) until desired sauciness is reached. Mix again, and leave on for 1 hour on low to infuse.
Serve. For best results, use toasted buns.

## Original source
https://www.skinnytaste.com/baked-chicken-parmesan/ 

## Ingredients
-  2 chicken breast, fat trimmed, sliced in half lengthwise to make 4
-  3/4 cup seasoned breadcrumbs (I used garlic & herb)
-  1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
-  4 tbsp butter, melted
-  Approx. 3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
-  1 cup marinara or Filetto di Pomodoro
-  cooking spray (ex: Pam)

## Instructions
1.  Preheat oven to 425°F
1.  Combine breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese in a bowl.
1.  Melt the butter in another bowl.
1.  Lightly brush the butter onto the chicken, then dip into breadcrumb mixture.  Place on baking sheet and repeat with the remaining chicken.
1.  Lightly spray the top with cooking spray.
1.  Lower temp to 400°F
1.  Bake in the oven for 20 minutes.
1.  Remove from oven, spoon 1 tbsp sauce over each piece of chicken and top each with approx. 1 1/2 tbsp of shredded mozzarella cheese.
1.  Increase temp to 425°F
1.  Bake 5 more minutes or until cheese is melted.

## Notes
-  This is for less chicken BUT used the same amount of breadcrumbs so there would be plenty. 
-  Originally suggests 2 tbsp but that isn't enough, increased to 4 tbsp.
-  Increasing temp/decreasing probably isn't required but I do it to handle the temperature loss when opening/closing the oven.
-  The original recipe baked at 450F for 25m, multiple people said this was too much. My attempt at 400F for 20m + 425F for 5m came out perfectly.
-  Served with ditalini pasta with a red pasta sauce instead of marinara.

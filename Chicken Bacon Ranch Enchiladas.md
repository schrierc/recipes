-  1 packet (1 oz) ranch dressing & seasoning mix 
-  1 (8 oz) can red enchilada sauce
-  2 cups shredded Mexican blend cheese 
-  20 Old El Paso™ flour tortillas for soft tacos & fajitas (6 inch)

-  2 tablespoons olive oil 
-  1/2 cup chopped onion 
-  1 packet (1 oz) ranch dressing & seasoning mix 
-  1 can (4.5 oz) Old El Paso™ chopped green chiles

## Directions 
1.  Heat oven to 375°F.
1.  Lightly grease 13x9 inch (3 quart) baking dish and 8 inch square (2 quart) baking dish.
1.  In large bowl, mix chicken, half of the crumbled bacon, 1 tablespoon of the ranch dressing & seasoning mix, the cooking sauce, and 1 cup of the cheese; mix well. 
1.  Divide mixture among tortillas, and roll up, placing seam side down in baking dishes. Set aside.

    If you want to freeze the smaller baking dish of enchiladas at this point, cover the baking dish with foil, and label before placing in the freezer. Use within 1 month. 
    
1.  In 10 inch skillet, heat oil over medium high heat.
1.  Cook onion in oil until softened. Add chilies, and cook until most of the liquid from chilies evaporates.
1.  Stir in flour.
1.  Slowly add chicken broth, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. 
1.  Once broth is incorporated, cook another minute or until slightly thickened.
1.  Stir in sour cream and ranch dressing & seasoning mix, simmer 1 minute. 
1.  Remove from heat, and pour over enchiladas. If baking both baking dishes, pour the sauce over both; otherwise, pour all of it into the 13x9 inch dish. (To make just enough for the smaller pan of enchiladas later, divide the recipe for the sauce in half. 
1.  Top with remaining cheese and bacon.
1.  Bake about 20 minutes until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbling.
1.  Cool 5 minutes before serving with garnishes.
